# 🎬 MovieApp

MovieApp is a responsive movie website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches and displays data from the TMDB API and allows users to explore trending movies, filter by genre, and view upcoming releases.

This project was designed and developed by me as part of my JavaScript learning journey.
